    "# An introduction to using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 10 minute tutorial for non-programmers to learn how developers use APIs - where you will actually <font color=blue>access real APIs</font> from inside your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>Get inside your programmer's head</font> Usually you have to rely on a programmer to do some magic to build an application that uses APIs. Here we attempt to look inside the programmers head, so you learn what that 'magic' is (the computer programs that they write). At times it might feel like you are having to learn maths again, but there's <font color=blue>no test at the end</font> so you don't have to understand it, just get the general idea of what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>All the tools you need are here on this page</font> We have created a 'sandbox' where you can read and run real computer programs below without having to download and install software to your device. If you are brave, you can <font color=blue>even change the programs</font> below to try different ways of using the APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can *not* break it!** When you opened this web page it created <font color=blue>a whole new copy just for you to play with</font>, the original version is not touched. \n",
    "* If things go badly, you can easily refresh the web page and start over again.\n",
    "* If things go well, who knows, you might decide to save your program and start learning how to download the software for yourself...\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans we use websites to get and give information. APIs (Application Programming Interface) are for computer systems to get and give that same information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computer systems are quite intelligent but also quite simple, so they don't understand huge blocks of words and images on web pages, that's why APIs break the information down into <font color=blue>small and structured pieces of data</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more in [Wikipedia's API entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) or watch this [3 minute video on APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to play this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To read computer programs, it's best to <font color=blue>think of a computer program as a recipe</font> - they usually start with a few ingredients, then the method explains the step-by-step how use those ingredients to make something. The difference is that instead of using fancy words that only cooks understand, programs use fancy words that only computers understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has one long computer program (written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language), but we are going to read and run (operate/execute) one section at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read each section's text (on a white background)\n",
    "2. See if you can <font color=blue>understand the program code</font> in the following grey box (with \"In[]\" next to it)\n",
    "3. Click on that grey box\n",
    "4. <font color=blue>Run that section of the program</font> (by clicking on the \"Run\" button at the top of this web page)\n",
    "5. Look at the output it shows\n",
    "6. Rinse and repeat (start at step (1) again)\n",
